*Fill out the form first based from the "CHOICES: " portion below* 

*If output too big for you to finish it, I will say to continue it*

**1.2**
*make a test based from the form
*Put the answers at the very bottom*

Consider some edge cases within the problems and even some odd patterns 


Make a coding exercise problem or application building using this format:

Problem Title/Task Title

Problem/Task summary

Example input/output 1, 2, ...

Constraints


# Finalize
*Dont tell the answers yet until 20 minutes*

*Put the answers at the very bottom part of your output*

**2nd prompt (Post).** 
Document and Summarize everything about all the pre existing context of the quizzes you have made with an emphasis to the edge cases being considered with simple examples 


along with dissecting its logic of each nature according to the quizzes being made previously in a bullet form

Also find the techniques and patterns used in order to answer all those questions correctly cosistently
